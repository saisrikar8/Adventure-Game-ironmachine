Once completed, please copy your personal Adventure Game code into the `main.py` and paste your github link in this `README.md` in the section below. 

1. Create a new Repl called "Adventure Game"
2. Set up version control
3. Print out the introduction to your story, set the scene (from #1 on the Worksheet)
4. Create the variables (from #2 on the Worksheet)
5. Print out the user options (A --> E...Z) (from #6 on the Worksheet)
6. Create your while loop with condition while(True)
7. Inside the while loop, create "if-statements" for each option
8. For now, do not write any code inside of the "if statements" besides the print statement
9. Update the user input so that you do not get stuck with an infinite loop

*Ex*
```python

if(userOption == "A"): 
  print("You chose A")
if(userOption == "A"): 
  print("You chose A")
```

Give me a "reaction" when you are done with these tasks

If you have questions feel free to ask each other and work as a class

# Can You Make it to Canada?
### By: Sai Srikar Tummala

### Introduction
You have hotwired a police car and stolen it. Little did you know, the police were keeping track of your location. It seems that the police are chasing you now! Your mission is to outrun the cops and make it across the Canadian border without being caught. You are in San Francisco, CA. The cop car that you stole has a radio that cops use, so you can hear their conversations.

### Instructions:
You will be given options and you have to answer with the corresponding letter(lower or uppercase). You must make it to Canada in 900 to 1000 miles. There are two routes that you will be able to choose at the beginning. The chosen route will determine the distance to Canada. You will recieve warnings when you are almost out of fuel, if you are tired, or if the cops are very close. You will lose if the cops arrest you, if you run out of fuel without refueling, or if you get too tired.


Here are your main options:
**
A. Drive over the speed limit.
B. Drive and abide to the rules.
C. Refuel
D. Stop for the night
E. Status Check
**
A full tank is 15 gallons of fuel. You will start with 3 refills of fuel. Option A will burn two gallons of fuel. Option B will burn through 1 gallon of fuel. Your sleepiness level is very important. If your sleepiness goes over level 15, you will be too tired to drive and crash. Therefore, you lose the game. To lower your sleepiness level, you can choose option D, which will allow you to stop at a motel to rest. Finally, option E will give you the status. It will show you your sleep level, the distance traveled, the remaining distance to Canada, how much fuel is left in the car, and how many remaining fuel refills you have left. You will get 3 seconds to read it.

### *Example*:
```
Here are your options:
A. Drive over the speed limit.
B. Drive and abide to the rules.
C. Refuel
D. Stop for the night
E. Status Check
Enter you choice. If you want to quit, enter 'q':
e

You have travelled 0 miles. 
You have to drive 1000 miles until you reach Canada.
You have a sleepiness level of 0 out of 15.
The cops are 3 miles away.
You have 15 gallons of fuel in your tank.
You have 3 refills left
```


### You are in pursuit!
The cops are on your tail! You speed through the roads of San Francisco. You hear the cops talking. "Dispatch. I have a visual of the suspect. Calling for backup. I repeat! Calling for backup." Escape the cop before the dispatcher sends backup!
